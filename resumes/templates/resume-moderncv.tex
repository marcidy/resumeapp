%Personal Statements
\section{Personal}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ask me about my website idea!  (And how it may compliment Kickstarter)
    \item I love to ride my bikes (plural, though not at the same time), whether it's banging around the city, up to Bear Mountain, or out to Montauk.  Cycling is very much my Zen garden.
%    \item I am also an avid baker, trying my best to make high quality bread, along with various confections.  I also experiement with extracts and tinctures, and I'm looking forward to when microstills are legal so I can use small batch alcohols instead of store bought.
